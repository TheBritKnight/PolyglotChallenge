The Polyglot Challenge
======================

52 Programming Languages in 52 weeks.

Each week I'll be experimenting in a different language and sharing my experiences on my blog (cdawson.net).

The Journey So Far:
-------------------

+ Week 1 : Haskell
+ Week 2 : Scala
+ Week 3 : Rust

What to expect in coming weeks
------------------------------

+ Dart
+ Scheme
+ Go
+ J

And a whole slew of turing tarpits and esoteric languages
+ INTERCAL: I don't even know what INTERCAL is
+ Brainfuck: 8 commands and an array
+ Whitespace: Only tabs, spaces, and linefeeds
+ Chef: Every program reads like a recipe
+ Piet: Programs look like abstract art

Requests

If you have a language you want to see me struggle through, drop me a line @ch_dawson or email root@cdawson.net.
