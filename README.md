The Polyglot Challenge
======================

52 Programming Languages in 52 weeks.

Each week I'll be experimenting in a different language and sharing my experiences on my blog (cdawson.net).

The Journey So Far:
-------------------

+ Week 1 : Haskell
+ Week 2 : Scala
+ Week 3 : Rust
+ Week 4 : Brainf*ck
+ Week 5 : Lisp
+ Week 6 : Julia
+ Week 7 : Go
+ Week 8 : Fortran
+ Week 9 : AppleScript
+ Week 10: Prolog
+ Week 11: Rails

What to expect in coming weeks
------------------------------

+ Dart
+ Scheme
+ J

And a whole slew of turing tarpits and esoteric languages
+ INTERCAL: I don't even know what INTERCAL is
+ Whitespace: Only tabs, spaces, and linefeeds
+ Chef: Every program reads like a recipe
+ Piet: Programs look like abstract art
