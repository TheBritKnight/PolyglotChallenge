The Polyglot Challenge
======================

52 Programming Languages in 52 weeks.

Each week I'll be experimenting in a different language and sharing my experiences on my blog (cdawson.net).

The Journey So Far:
-------------------

+ Week 1 : Haskell

What to expect in coming weeks
------------------------------

+ Scala
+ Rust
+ Dart
+ Scheme
+ Go

And a whole slew of turing tarpits and esoteric languages
+ Brainfuck: 8 commands and an array
+ Whitespace: Only tabs, spaces, and linefeeds
+ Chef: Every program reads like a recipe
+ Piet: Programs look like abstract art
+ LOLCODE: Can i haz STDIO?
