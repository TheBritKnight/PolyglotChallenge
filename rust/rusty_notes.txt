+ Rust seems to be all about concurrency. It's basically C but with concurrent programming made easier.
+ Everything is in support of that concurrency, such as the
    + MEMORY MODEL
        + Good thing to talk about in post
        + Memory has 3 parts: items, stacks, and heap
            + Items have their value calculated at compile-time, and are neither dynamically allocated nor freed.
            + Stack: each task has it's own stack. The Stack model is pretty standard. Allocations are called "slots"
            + Heap: Allocations are called "boxes", and there are two types: managed and owned. Managed are subject to garbage-collection, owned are not (?).
